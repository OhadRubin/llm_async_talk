- The user panels are updated with their character names: User 1 becomes "Dwight", User 2 becomes "Jim", and User 3 becomes "Micheal". Jim and Micheal begin thinking about their next moves upon logging in. Both see other participants are present and decide to call the `check` function to get the latest chat state before posting a message.
- Micheal's `check` function completes. His "Last System Message" updates to "Dwight has claimed the talking stick and wants to speak", informing him of Dwight's action.
- Jim's `check` function completes. His "Last System Message" also updates to "Dwight has claimed the talking stick and wants to speak". Now both Jim and Micheal are aware that Dwight is about to say something.- Dwight, who has the talking stick, prepares his message by calling `Function: append` with the text "Hi everyone! Dwight here. How's everyone doing?". Simultaneously, Micheal notices Dwight's intent to speak and calls `check` again to retrieve the upcoming message. The "Last System Message" for all three users is updated to reflect that "Dwight has claimed the talking stick and wants to speak".
- Jim, having seen the notification about Dwight, updates his thought process to "I see Dwight has claimed the talking stick and wants to speak. Let me wait to see what they say before introducing myself." He then calls `check` to wait for Dwight's message.- Dwight executes `Function: push`, which sends his appended message to the chatroom. His "Last System Message" changes to "Micheal has been waiting for a response for 4 seconds...".- Dwight's message, "Dwight: Hi everyone! Dwight here. How's everyone doing?", appears in Jim's chat history. The "Last System Message" for both Jim and Micheal is updated to "Micheal has been waiting for a response for 4 seconds...".

- Jim's `check` function completes. Having seen Dwight's message and the system notification that Micheal was waiting, he formulates a new plan. A new thought bubble appears for Jim: "I can see that Micheal has been waiting for a response and Dwight just introduced himself. Let me claim the talking stick and respond with a greeting."
- Jim proceeds with his plan. The old thought bubble fades, and the `check` function is replaced by a call to `Function: talking_stick` as Jim attempts to claim his turn to speak.

Unaware that Jim has just claimed the stick, Micheal calls `Function: talking_stick`. This creates a race condition where both want to speak.
- The system resolves the race condition. Micheal's attempt to claim the talking stick fails because Jim already has it. His "Last System Message" updates to reflect the true state of the chatroom: "Jim has claimed the talking stick and wants to speak."- Jim, who successfully claimed the talking stick, now prepares his message. He calls `Function: append` with the text "Hi everyone! I'm Jim. Good to meet you all."

- Micheal's `check` function completes, and Jim's message now appears in his chat history.
- Now that Micheal has seen both greetings, he decides it's finally his turn. The thought bubble updates to "Okay, everyone has said hi except for me. Let me claim the talking stick now," and he calls `Function: talking_stick`.
- This time, Micheal's attempt is successful. His "Last System Message" confirms, "You have the talking stick."
