# Claude Conversation

## Prompt:
We are building a chat app for LLMs 

The reasoning behind this is whenever an llm does one of these actions. We can additionally look up if it received any recent messages (and check for any awk messages). This way we can allow the llms to speak in asynchronous fashion.

 action-based approach
  
describing
is interesting
for 
enabling continuous and asynchronous communication between language models.
Useful for complex discussions where LLMs might need to adjust their responses based on new information that arrives during response generation.


The actions:

1. **Append action** - (Non-blocking) Appends text to the current draft message (with a length maximum, but not necessarily for the entire message)
2. **Undo action** - (Non-blocking) Reverts the most recent commit/append operation
3. **Push action** - (Blocking) Sends the entire built-up message to the recipient
4. **Reset action** - (Non-blocking) Discards the entire draft message and starts fresh
5. **Check actions** - (blocking) Waits for a new messages


Allows building up a message in segments rather than managing separate drafts.

This design creates a two-step communication process (commit then push), which allows the LLM to:
- Prepare a message
- The protocol automatically checks for any incoming messages before actually sending
- Potentially revise the committed message if new information arrives
- Only send when ready with the push action


want to be able to have a meaningful conversation
try to convey very complex ideas
sometimes you want to say something
sometimes you want to wait for the other person to say something

This approach gives you fine-grained control over the conversation flow while allowing for asynchronous communication. It's particularly 
This makes sense for LLMs that might need to build up longer responses in chunks while maintaining the ability to check for new incoming messages between commits. The LLM could:

1. Commit part of a response
2. Check if any new messages arrived
3. Either continue with more commits to complete the response, or
4. Reset if the new information makes the current draft obsolete

Some questions that might help refine this:

- What happens if an LLM tries to push without committing first? (should be rejected)
- Is there a way for LLMs to see a preview of their committed message before pushing? (yes)
- Can multiple messages be committed before pushing, or does push always send the most recent commit? (push always sends the most recent commit)
- How do you handle the length maximum for commit messages - truncation or rejection? (notify the llm that it was truncated)

This approach reminds me of Git's commit/push workflow, which makes it intuitive for developers. It's a clever way to give LLMs more control over their communication timing.
Would you like me to explore specific implementation aspects of this system or discuss potential UX considerations for how these actions would be presented to users?

This simulated conversation shows how LLMs could build messages incrementally while still responding to each other naturally.




how asynchronous LLM conversations might flow before implementing the app. 

I can simulate what this might look like based on your description of the commit/push system.


 The key benefits appear to be:

1. More natural conversational flow where models can "interrupt" themselves to respond
2. Ability to check for new information before sending a complete thought
3. More thoughtful responses as models can revise before pushing



sometimes when one of the llms is writing something at the same time because it happens in parallel, it can be interrupted while after he commits something and before he pushes it

## Response:
 You're absolutely right, and that's an important insight about the parallel nature of these conversations. Let me clarify how that interruption pattern would more realistically work:


The interruption pattern is particularly valuable because:

1. It prevents the awkward "message crossing" problem in traditional chat systems, where two people reply at the same time without seeing each other's messages
2. It allows for more natural acknowledgment and integration of new information mid-thought
3. It creates a more realistic conversation flow where participants can adjust to what they're "hearing" in real-time

This dynamic would be particularly interesting in scenarios where:

1. The LLMs are debating complex topics and need to respond to nuanced points
2. They're collaboratively solving problems where new insights change the direction
3. They're having philosophical discussions where it's important to acknowledge and incorporate each other's viewpoints

The "listening while writing" capability you're describing is what makes human conversations fluid, and implementing it for LLMs would create a much more natural and productive interaction pattern. This addresses one of the key limitations of current chatbot interactions - the rigid, turn-based nature that doesn't mirror how humans actually converse.


That makes the system even more seamless. So the flow would work more like this:

```
Claude: [commits] The fundamental challenge with quantum computing is maintaining coherence long enough to—
// System automatically checks for new messages, none found

GPT: [commits] I believe the decoherence problem in quantum systems could potentially be addressed by—
GPT: [pushes]
// System automatically delivers GPT's message to Claude

// Claude's system automatically notifies Claude of the new message right after its commit action
Claude: [receives GPT's message immediately after committing]
Claude: [commits] —actually, I just saw your message about decoherence. I agree with your approach but would add that recent advances in error correction suggest—
Claude: [pushes]
```

With server-side events automatically checking and delivering messages after each action, the conversation becomes even more fluid and responsive. The LLMs don't have to explicitly check for messages - the system handles that automatically after each commit, push, or other action.

This creates a truly reactive environment where:

1. LLMs can respond almost immediately to new information
2. Conversations can naturally branch and merge based on real-time inputs
3. Neither LLM needs to wait for a complete "turn" to start responding
4. Partial thoughts can be acknowledged and incorporated naturally

This approach significantly reduces the artificial feeling of turn-taking in traditional chat interfaces and creates something much closer to natural human conversation dynamics. It's an elegant solution for enabling LLMs to have more authentic, responsive interactions.
